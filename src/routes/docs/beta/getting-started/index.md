# Getting Started

Learn how to start using Gitpod on an example project that is hosted on Github. However, the steps outlined works for a project hosted on any Git provider. This section helps you understand the features and advantages of Gitpod in a learning environment.

## Quick Start on an Example Project

In this task you learn how to create an issue, configure the project with a prebuild events, create a pull request, open the pull request in Gitpod, and see the prebuild events. The example project that is used in the following section is a [Java with Boot Spring](https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) application.

### Before you Begin

- Install Gitpod browser extension.

  You can install Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

  **Note:** If you do not want to install the browser extension prefix `gitpod.io/#` to the URL of the repositories in the following steps `https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic`.

- Install [Gitpod GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/gitpod-io). For instructions to install, see [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/purchasing-and-installing-apps-in-github-marketplace/installing-an-app-in-your-organization#installing-a-github-app-in-your-organization).
- Fork the [Java with Boot Spring](https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) repository in GitHub.

- Delete the `gitpod.yml` file in your personal repository `https://github.com/<github_username>/spring-petclinic`

1. Open a Gitpod workspace for the project on your persoanl repository by clicking the **Gitpod** button.
   **Note:**
   When Gitpod opens the workspace it displays the status checking, preparing, creating, and starting status in the browser.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Click the _Github_ icon on the VisualStudio Code sidebar and click _Create an Issue_.
   Gitpod opens _NewIssue.md_ file in the editor.
4. Type the title of the issue as _Configure Gitpod_, set the assign the issue to yourself by typing your github user name in the **Assignee** field. Add the description of the issue as _Format the Readme.md file_
5. Click the **Create Issue** icon.

6. To open the example Java with Spring Boot project in a browser, click the [Java with Spring Boot](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) project link.

   Gitpod opens an automated, and fully configured development environment of the example Java with Spring Boot project in a workspace:

![Workspace of Java with Spring Boot Project](../../../../static/images/docs/beta/getting-started/java-with-spring-boot-workspace.png)

2. After the project starts, a _BUILD SUCCESS_ message appears in the **Terminal** tab at the bottom of the screen.

![Buils Success message in the terminal](../../../../static/images/docs/beta/getting-started/terminal-message.png)

3. To view the application running in a new browser click **Open in browser** icon that appears in the **Simple Browser** pane of the Gitpod development environment.

#### Personalize the Workspace Theme

You can access the Visual Studio Code in your workspace. In the following example, you install an extension that sets the theme of your workspace

1. In the left sidebarn of Visual Studio Code, click the Extensions icon.
2. In the search bar, type _Quiet Light Theme_ and click the **Manage** icon.

   A pop-up menu appears:
   ![Quite light theme menu](../../../../static/images/docs/beta/getting-started/quite-light-theme.png)

3. Select the **Set Color Theme** option.

   A **Select Color Theme** search bar that lists **Quite Light** appears in the workspace.

   ![Select Color Theme](../../../../static/images/docs/beta/getting-started/select-color-theme.png)

4. Select the **Quite Light** option.

**Note:** _Quite Light Theme_ is a built-in theme and by default it is enabled globally across all your workspaces. If you would like to have this theme for your current workspace only then, clear the selection of **Sync This Extension** option in the pop-up menu that appears when you click the **Manage** icon.

### Working on Open Source Projects

Setting up a local dev environment to contribute to your favourite OSS project can be daunting. Luckily, already numerous projects have gitpodified their repositories to enable everyone to contribute with a single click. You can find the list of all Open Source Projects that are integrated with Gitpod on [contribute.dev](https://contribute.dev/).

Here's a list of some of the popular OSS projects. Just click the links and contribute to the projects using Gitpod:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
- [Prometheus](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
- [GitLab](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
- [Forem](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/forem/forem) powering [dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [Nushell](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nushell/nushell)

#### Creating a Pull Request

The following steps are specific for GitLab open source project. However, the steps outlined are applicable to all projects hosted on various Git providers.

**Before you Begin**

- Login to GitLab and [Enable Gitpod in your user settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html#enable-gitpod-in-your-user-settings).

  **Note:** You need to enable Gitpod on GitLab only the first time you use Gitpod on any project hosted in GitLab.

To submit a pull request for any [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/) listed in the GitLab open source project.

1. Open an issue in the project for which you want to submit a pull request by using the following URL format in the browser:
   `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/<issue-number>`

   _Where_: `<issue-number>` is the number assigned to the issue in the GitLab project.

   Gitpod opens a workspace with a new branch for the related issue in Visual Studio Code. You can find the details of the branch at the bottom of the workspace.

2. Update the changes that you want to make in the files of the project repository.

3. Commit the changes that you made by adding a commit message and click the _Commit_ icon in Visual Studio Code.

4. Create a pull request by clicking the _Create Pull Request_ icon in Visual Studio Code.

   For detailed instructions about creating a pull request in Visual Studio Code, see [create a pull request](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_creating-pull-requests).

## Using a Prefixed URL

You can quickly open a new workspace for any GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket project, by just prefixing **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the project in the address bar of the browser.

Gitpod presents you with useful productivity boosts not just when you prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the main URL of the repository, but also for issues, or pull requests.

For example, to open the repository, pull request, or an issue in the Java with Spring Boot project:

- **Repository:** prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the repository *https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic*.

  The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic`

- **Pull Request:** prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the merge request *https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2*.

  The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2`

- **Issue:** prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the issue *https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/issues/1*.

  The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/issues/1`

## Installing Browser Extension

Gitpod browser extension works with Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, and Firefox browser. The Gitpod extension adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket so that you can easily open a new workspace for any existing project.
![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

Install the Gitpod browser extension that are available here:

- [Chrome Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki)
- [Firefox Gitpod extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/)

## Next Steps

With Gitpod you start treating your dev environments as something ephemeral: you start them, you code, you push your code, and you forget about them. For your next task, you'll use a fresh dev environment.
