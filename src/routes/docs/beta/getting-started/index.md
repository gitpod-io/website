# Getting Started

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is an open source platform for automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends into the existing workflow.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) offers an automated, ephemeral cloud-powered development environment that enables you to experiment with complex software development stacks using a web browser without the need to install software or configure. You also dont have to upgrade the hardware of the developer environment to increase the productivity.

### Learning environment

Learn how to start using Gitpod on an example project or an example open source project using one of the following methods:

- Quick start using an [Example Project](#example-project) or [OSS Project](#gitpodified-open-source-project)
- Use a [Prefixed URL](#prefixed-url)
- Install [Browser Extension](#browser-extension)

### Example Project

The projects listed in the [example projects](/docs/examples) already have a working Gitpod configuration, you can inspect the configurations and try them out in Gitpod.

In the following example, you can open the [Vuepress](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) application project, customize the [workspace](/docs/workspaces), and create a pull request.

#### Open the Application

1. Open the example Vuepress project in a browser using the following URL: `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress`

   Gitpod opens an automated, and fully configured development environment of the example Vuepress project in a workspace:

2. After the project starts, a build success message with a link to the forwarded port appears in the **Terminal** tab at the bottom of the screen.

3. To view the application running in a browser click **Follow link using forwarded port** that appears in the **Terminal** tab.

   **Note:** You can also view the application in the **Simple Browser** pane of the Gitpod development environment.

#### Customize the Workspace

You can also customize the workspace with tools and languages, settings and keybindings, and color theme.

- To install additional tools to support various programming lanugugaes click **Tools and languages** in the **Customize** section of the **Welcome** pane.

  A list of all supported tools for various programming languages appears in the IDE.

- To install the settings and keyboard shortcuts for various editors click **Settings and keybindings** in the **Welcome** pane.

  A list of all supported keybiindings for various editors appears in the explorer of IDE.

- To personalize the editor and the code click **Color theme** in the **Welcome**

  A popup menu appears with all the available themes.

## Prefixed URL

You can quickly open a new workspace for the project using a context URL like repository, branch, pull request, issue, or file. Just prefix the URL in the address bar of your browser with `gitpod.io/#`.

For example, try opening [https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic) or [https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2](https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2).

## Browser Extension

For convenience, we've made a browser extension that works with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The extension adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket so you can easily open a new workspace for any existing project.

## GitLab Integration

GitLab comes with a native Gitpod which is enabled by default for GitLab.com. To use the GitLab integration, you need to enable it from your [user preferences](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/preferences) at GitLab. Then you can choose to open a Gitpod workspace as an alternative to the GitLab Web IDE directly from GitLab for any existing project.

## Example Project

Many example projects already have a working Gitpod configuration. We've listed a few of them in ## Example Project

Many example projects already have a working Gitpod configuration. We've listed a few of them in [Example Projects](/docs/examples) so that you can inspect their configurations and try them out in Gitpod.

For instance, you could try opening [Vuepress](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) or a [Java with Spring Boot](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) example. so that you can inspect their configurations and try them out in Gitpod.

## Gitpodified Open Source Projects

Setting up a local dev environment for a contribution to your favourite OSS project can be daunting. Luckily there are already numerous projects out there that gitpodified their repositories allowing everyone to contribute with a single click. With [contribute.dev](https://contribute.dev/) we even made a website to list them.

See for yourself and try opening some of our favorite OSS projects out there:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
- [Prometheus](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
- [GitLab](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
- [Forem](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/forem/forem) powering [dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [Nushell](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nushell/nushell)

## Next Steps

With Gitpod you start treating your dev environments as something ephemeral: you start them, you code, you push your code, and you forget about them. For your next task, you'll use a fresh dev environment.
