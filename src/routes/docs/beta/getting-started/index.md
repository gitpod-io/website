# Getting Started

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is an open source platform for automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends into your existing workflow.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) offers an automated, ephemeral cloud-powered development environment that enables you to experiment with complex software development stacks using a web browser without the need to install software or configure anything on your local environment. You also don't have to upgrade the hardware of the developer environment to increase the productivity.

## Quick Start Environment

Learn how to start using Gitpod on an example project or an example open source project using one of the following methods:

- Opening an [Example Project](#example-project) or [OSS Project](#gitpodified-open-source-project)
- Using a [Prefixed URL](#prefixed-url)
- Installing a [Browser Extension](#browser-extension)

### Example Project

The projects listed in the [example projects](/docs/examples) already have a working Gitpod configuration, you can inspect the configurations and try them out in Gitpod.

In the following example, you can open the [Java with Spring Boot](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) application project, customize the [workspace](/docs/workspaces), and create a pull request.

### Open the Application

1. To open the example Java with Spring Boot project in a browser, click the [Java with Spring Boot](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) project link.

   Gitpod opens an automated, and fully configured development environment of the example Vuepress project in a workspace:

2. After the project starts, a _BUILD SUCCESS_ message appears in the **Terminal** tab at the bottom of the screen.

3. To view the application running in a new browser click **Open in browser** icon that appears in the **Simple Browser** pane of the Gitpod development environment.

### Customize the Workspace

You can also customize the workspace with tools and languages, settings and keybindings, and color theme.

- To install additional tools to support various programming langugaes click **Tools and languages** in the **Customize** section of the **Welcome** pane.

  A list of all supported tools for various programming languages appears in the IDE.

- To install the settings and keyboard shortcuts for various editors click **Settings and keybindings** in the **Welcome** pane.

  A list of all supported keybiindings for various editors appears in the explorer of IDE.

- To personalize the editor and the code click **Color theme** in the **Welcome**

  A popup menu appears with all the available themes.

### Open Source Projects

Setting up a local dev environment to contribute to your favourite OSS project can be daunting. Luckily, already numerous projects have gitpodified their repositories to enable everyone to contribute with a single click. You can find the list of all Open Source Projects that are integrated with Gitpod on [contribute.dev](https://contribute.dev/).

Here's a list of some of the popular OSS projects. Just click the links to contribute using Gitpod:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)
- [Prometheus](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
- [GitLab](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
- [Forem](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/forem/forem) powering [dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [Nushell](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nushell/nushell)

## Prefixed URL

You can quickly open a new workspace for any GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket project, by just prefixing **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the project in the address bar of the browser.

Gitpod presents you with useful productivity boosts not just when you prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the main URL of the repository, but also for issues, or pull requests.

For example:

- To open the Java with Spring Boot project repository prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the repository *https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic*.

  The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic`

- To open a specific merge request in the Java with Spring Boot project prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the merge request *https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2*.

  The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/merge_requests/2`

- To open a specific issue in the Java with Spring Boot project prefix **gitpod.io/#** to the URL of the merge request *https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/issues/1*.

  The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitpod/spring-petclinic/-/issues/1`

## Browser Extension

For convenience, we've made a browser extension that works with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. The extension adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket so you can easily open a new workspace for any existing project.

## Next Steps

With Gitpod you start treating your dev environments as something ephemeral: you start them, you code, you push your code, and you forget about them. For your next task, you'll use a fresh dev environment.
