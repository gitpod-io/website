# Quickstart with example projects

Learn how to start using Gitpod on an example project that is hosted on Github. However, the steps outlined works for a project hosted on any Git provider. This section helps you understand the features and advantages of Gitpod in a learning environment.

## Java Example Project

The example project that is used in the following section is a [Java with Boot Spring](https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic) application. In this task you learn how to configure the project with a prebuild events and see the prebuild events.

1. Create a project by clicking the [Java template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic/generate).

2. Update the _readme.md_ to display the steps documented in this section.

3. Install [Gitpod GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/gitpod-io). For instructions to install, see [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/purchasing-and-installing-apps-in-github-marketplace/installing-an-app-in-your-organization#installing-a-github-app-in-your-organization).

Gitpod GitHub app generates Gitpod links for pull requests and adds them to the description, it also prebuilds workspaces for branches and pull requests.

4. Start your work space with a prebuild by prefixing **https://gitpod.io#prebuild/** to the URL of the repository *https://github.com/<github_username>/spring-petclinic/*.

The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<github_username>/spring-petclinic/`

Gitpod display the prebuild progress status with by running the init commands in the `.gitpod.yml` before you even start a workspace. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request, for which a prebuild exists, the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencie are already downloaded ahead of time, and the code is already compiled.

5.  Gitpod starts an automated, and fully configured development environment for the project in a workspace that is now ready for you to code.

#### Creating a Pull Request

The following steps are specific for GitLab open source project. However, the steps outlined are applicable to all projects hosted on various Git providers.

**Before you Begin**

- Login to GitLab and [Enable Gitpod in your user settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/gitpod.html#enable-gitpod-in-your-user-settings).

  **Note:** You need to enable Gitpod on GitLab only the first time you use Gitpod on any project hosted in GitLab.

To submit a pull request for any [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/) listed in the GitLab open source project.

1. Open an issue in the project for which you want to submit a pull request by using the following URL format in the browser:
   `https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/<issue-number>`

   _Where_: `<issue-number>` is the number assigned to the issue in the GitLab project.

   Gitpod opens a workspace with a new branch for the related issue in Visual Studio Code. You can find the details of the branch at the bottom of the workspace.

2. Update the changes that you want to make in the files of the project repository.

3. Commit the changes that you made by adding a commit message and click the _Commit_ icon in Visual Studio Code.

4. Create a pull request by clicking the _Create Pull Request_ icon in Visual Studio Code.

   For detailed instructions about creating a pull request in Visual Studio Code, see [create a pull request](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_creating-pull-requests).

## Install a Browser Extension

You can install Gitpod browser extension on any [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Chrome, and others, or on a [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/gitpod/) browser.

The Gitpod extension adds a Gitpod button on every project and branch across GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket so that you can easily open a new workspace for any existing project.

## Next Steps

With Gitpod you start treating your dev environments as something ephemeral: you start them, you code, you push your code, and you forget about them. For your next task, you'll use a fresh dev environment.
